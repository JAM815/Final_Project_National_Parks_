# Final Project - National Parks
Created in Python, this project uses a CSV file, containing over a 500 cells, and calls several functions which allows the user to pick 
one of 5 different options.

**Option "A"** displays all of the name of the National Parks in the CSV file along with their four letter abbreviation, the state in which they are located,
            their size in acres, and the date in which they were established.

**Option "B"** displays all the name of the National Parks in a specific state. This is done by asking for user input, specifically the two letter abbreviation of
            the state the user is looking for.
            
**Option "C"** diplays the name of largest National Park along with its four letter abbreviation, the state in which it is located,
            its size in acres, the date in which they were established, and a small description of the park.
            
**Option "D"** asks the user for keywords which are used to display all the names of all National Parks with those keywords. All results will also include
            their four letter abbreviation, the state in which they are located their size in acres, and the date in which they were established
            and a small description of the park.

**Option "Q"** quits the program.
